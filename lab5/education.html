        <h2>Parkland High School</h2>
        <p>Favorite class: band class</p>
        <aside>
            <p>All of my friends were in band, and every Friday night, the marching band had to go out and play at the football games.  Everybody acted like it was a total drag, but secretly everyone knew it was a ton of fun.  We spent every Friday dancing around in the stands with our friends and making music.</p>
