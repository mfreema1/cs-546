        <h2>My Whole Life Story (In a Nutshell)</h2>
        <p>I was born in Allentown Pennsylvania, to a family that lived on a farm in New Tripoli, PA.  For those who don't know, New Tripoli is literally the middle of nowhere. Growing up on a farm was an interesting experience which got me interested in heavy machinery.</p>
        <p>Eventually I moved back to Allentown and graduated high school.  I then went on to study Mechanical Engineering for a year before switching to Software Engineering after meeting some great people in software and falling in love with the field.</p>
