    <h1>The Time I Crashed My OS</h1>
    <main>
        <p>So picture this: I'm working very late on an assignment for a course I cannot remember, but I do know that it had something to do with python.  I was messing around with my system's file directory, trying to get something with Python to work, but it kept complaining about something to do with Python2.7.</p>
        <p>So, like any rational human would do, I go to my `lib` directory and decide I'm just going to delete Python2.7 -- I don't use it anyways.  Immediately, Linux tells me "hey buddy, you probably don't wanna do that, it's a protected system file, but you can if you want to", and because I know exactly what I'm doing, I hit 'yes'.</p>
        <p>Horrible idea.  The second that I do, my computer crashes.  On reboot, it just loads into a desktop, but without a taskbar, mouse, or anything -- just the background.  At this point -- not only am I trying to turn in my assignment on time, but my computer appears to be broken and I'm worried about my data.</p>
        <p>Eventually I am able to get a terminal open via system recovery, and manage to transfer off my entire user directory to a USB after several hours.  Needless to say I did not get the assignment in on time.</p>
        <p>Lesson learned: When Linux tells you that you probably don't wanna do something, listen.</p>
